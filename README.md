## Grade and my feedback

96/100

Your code is nicely structured.

Your program should display an error and re-prompt for input if the user
enters multiple characters. Also, your program should display the list of
characters that have already been guessed.

I expect to see some git commits from both people working on a project. Please
remember this for the future.
